    "text": "What are Derivatives? The term \"Derivative\" indicates that it has no independent value, i.e. its value is entirely \"derived\" from the value of the underlying asset. The underlying asset can be Securities, Commodities, Bullion, Currency, Livestock or anything else. In other words, Derivative means a forward, future, option or any other hybrid contract of pre determined fixed duration, linked for the purpose of contract fulfillment to the value of a specified real or financial asset or to an index of securities. With Securities Laws (Second Amendment) Act,1999, Derivatives has been included in the definition of Securities. The term Derivative has been defined in Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, as:- �a security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan, whether secured or unsecured, risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security; �a contract which derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, of underlying securities. What is a Futures Contract? Futures Contract means a legally binding agreement to buy or sell the underlying security on a future date. Future contracts are the organized/standardized contracts in terms of quantity, quality (in case of commodities), delivery time and place for settlement on any date in future. The contract expires on a pre-specified date which is called the expiry date of the contract. On expiry, futures can be settled by delivery of the underlying asset or cash. Cash settlement enables the settlement of obligations arising out of the future/option contract in cash. What is an Option Contract? Option Contract is a type of Derivatives Contract which gives the buyer/holder of the contract the right (but not the obligation) to buy/sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price within or at end of a specified period. The buyer/holder of the option purchases the right from the seller/writer for a consideration which is called the premium. The seller/writer of an option is obligated to settle the option as per the terms of the contract when the buyer/holder exercises his right. The underlying asset could include securities, an index of prices of securities etc. Under Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act,1956 options on securities has been defined as \"option in securities\" means a contract for the purchase or sale of a right to buy or sell, or a right to buy and sell, securities in future, and includes a teji, a mandi, a teji mandi, a galli, a put, a call or a put and call in securities. An Option to buy is called Call option and option to sell is called Put option. Further, if an option that is exercisable on or before the expiry date is called American option and one that is exercisable only on expiry date, is called European option. The price at which the option is to be exercised is called Strike price or Exercise price. Therefore, in the case of American options the buyer has the right to exercise the option at anytime on or before the expiry date. This request for exercise is submitted to the Exchange, which randomly assigns the exercise request to the sellers of the options, who are obligated to settle the terms of the contract within a specified time frame. As in the case of futures contracts, option contracts can be also be settled by delivery of the underlying asset or cash. However, unlike futures cash settlement in option contract entails paying/receiving the difference between the strike price/exercise price and the price of the underlying asset either at the time of expiry of the contract or at the time of exercise / assignment of the option contract. What are Index Futures and Index Option Contracts? Futures contract based on an index i.e. the underlying asset is the index, are known as Index Futures Contracts. For example, futures contract on NIFTY Index and BSE-30 Index. These contracts derive their value from the value of the underlying index. Similarly, the options contracts, which are based on some index, are known as Index options contract. However, unlike Index Futures, the buyer of Index Option Contracts has only the right but not the obligation to buy / sell the underlying index on expiry. Index Option Contracts are generally European Style options i.e. they can be exercised / assigned only on the expiry date. An index, in turn derives its value from the prices of securities that constitute the index and is created to represent the sentiments of the market as a whole or of a particular sector of the economy. Indices that represent the whole market are broad based indices and those that represent a particular sector are sectoral indices. In the beginning futures and options were permitted only on S&P Nifty and BSE Sensex. Subsequently, sectoral indices were also permitted for derivatives trading subject to fulfilling the eligibility criteria. Derivative contracts may be permitted on an index if 80% of the index constituents are individually eligible for derivatives trading. However, no single ineligible stock in the index shall have a weightage of more than 5% in the index. The index is required to fulfill the eligibility criteria even after derivatives trading on the index has begun. If the index does not fulfill the criteria for 3 consecutive months, then derivative contracts on such index would be discontinued. By its very nature, index cannot be delivered on maturity of the Index futures or Index option contracts therefore, these contracts are essentially cash settled on Expiry. What is the structure of deravatives markets in India? Derivative trading in India takes can place either on a separate and independent Derivative Exchange or on a separate segment of an existing Stock Exchange. Derivative Exchange/Segment function as a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) and SEBI acts as the oversight regulator. The clearing & settlement of all trades on the Derivative Exchange/Segment would have to be through a Clearing Corporation/House, which is independent in governance and membership from the Derivative Exchange/Segment. What is the regulatory framework of derivatives markets in India? With the amendment in the definition of ''securities'' under SC(R)A (to include derivative contracts in the definition of securities), derivatives trading takes place under the provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. Dr. L.C Gupta Committee constituted by SEBI had laid down the regulatory framework for derivative trading in India. SEBI has also framed suggestive bye-law for Derivative Exchanges/Segments and their Clearing Corporation/House which lays down the provisions for trading and settlement of derivative contracts. The Rules, Bye-laws & Regulations of the Derivative Segment of the Exchanges and their Clearing Corporation/House have to be framed in line with the suggestive Bye-laws. SEBI has also laid the eligibility conditions for Derivative Exchange/Segment and its Clearing Corporation/House. The eligibility conditions have been framed to ensure that Derivative Exchange/Segment & Clearing Corporation/House provide a transparent trading environment, safety & integrity and provide facilities for redressal of investor grievances. Some of the important eligibility conditions are - 1.Derivative trading to take place through an online screen based Trading System. 2.The Derivatives Exchange/Segment shall have online surveillance capability to monitor positions, prices, and volumes on a real time basis to deter market manipulation. 3.The Derivatives Exchange/ Segment should have arrangements for dissemination of information about trades, quantities and quotes on a real time basis through atleast two information vending networks, which are easily accessible to investors across the country. 4.The Derivatives Exchange/Segment should have arbitration and investor grievances redressal mechanism operative from all the four areas / regions of the country. 5.The Derivatives Exchange/Segment should have satisfactory system of monitoring investor complaints and preventing irregularities in trading. 6.The Derivative Segment of the Exchange would have a separate Investor Protection Fund. 7.The Clearing Corporation/House shall perform full novation, i.e. the Clearing Corporation/House shall interpose itself between both legs of every trade, becoming the legal counterparty to both or alternatively should provide an unconditional guarantee for settlement of all trades. 8.The Clearing Corporation/House shall have the capacity to monitor the overall position of Members across both derivatives market and the underlying securities market for those Members who are participating in both. 9.The level of initial margin on Index Futures Contracts shall be related to the risk of loss on the position.

Presently, SEBI has permitted Derivative Trading on the Derivative Segment of BSE and the F&O Segment of NSE. What are the various membership categories in the derivatives market? The various types of membership in the derivatives market are as follows: 1.Trading Member (TM) � A TM is a member of the derivatives exchange and can trade on his own behalf and on behalf of his clients. 2.Clearing Member (CM) �These members are permitted to settle their own trades as well as the trades of the other non-clearing members known as Trading Members who have agreed to settle the trades through them. 3.Self-clearing Member (SCM) � A SCM are those clearing members who can clear and settle their own trades only. What are the requirements to be a member of the Derivatives Exchange/Clearing Corporation? 1.Balance Sheet Networth Requirements: SEBI has prescribed a networth requirement of Rs. 3 crores for clearing members. The clearing members are required to furnish an auditor's certificate for the networth every 6 months to the exchange. The networth requirement is Rs. 1 crore for a self-clearing member. SEBI has not specified any networth requirement for a trading member. 2.Liquid Networth Requirements: Every clearing member (both clearing members and self-clearing members) has to maintain at least Rs. 50 lakhs as Liquid Networth with the Exchange/Clearing Corporation. 3.Certification requirements: The Members are required to pass the certification programme approved by SEBI. Further, every trading member is required to appoint at least two approved users who have passed the certification programme. Only the approved users are permitted to operate the derivatives trading terminal. What are requirements for a Member with regard to the conduct of his business? The derivatives member is required to adhere to the code of conduct specified under the SEBI Broker Sub-Broker regulations. The following conditions stipulations have been laid by SEBI on the regulation of sales practices: 1.Sales Personnel: The derivatives exchange recognizes the persons recommended by the Trading Member and only such persons are authorized to act as sales personnel of the TM.

What derivatives contracts are permitted by SEBI? Derivative products have been introduced in a phased manner starting with Index Futures Contracts in June 2000. Index Options and Stock Options were introduced in June 2001 and July 2001 followed by Stock Futures in November 2001. Sectoral Indices were permitted for derivatives trading in December 2002. Interest Rate Futures on a notional bond and T-bill priced off ZCYC have been introduced in June 2003 and Exchange Traded Interest Rate Futures on a notional bond priced off a basket of Government Securities were permitted for trading in January 2004. What is the eligibility criterion for stocks on which derivatives trading may be permitted? A stock on which Stock Option and single Stock Future contracts are proposed to be introduced is required to fulfill the following broad eligibility criteria:- 1.The stock shall be chosen from amongst the top 500 stocks in terms of average daily market capitalisation and average daily traded value in the previous six month on a rolling basis. 2.The stock�s median quarter-sigma order size over the last six months shall be not less than Rs.1 Lakh. A stock�s quarter-sigma order size is the mean order size (in value terms) required to cause a change in the stock price equal to one-quarter of a standard deviation. 3.The market wide position limit in the stock shall not be less than Rs.50 crores. A stock can be included for derivatives trading as soon as it becomes eligible. However, if the stock does not fulfill the eligibility criteria for 3 consecutive months after being admitted to derivatives trading, then derivative contracts on such a stock would be discontinued. What is Mimimum Contract Size? The Standing Committee on Finance, a Parliamentary Committee, at the time of recommending amendment to Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 had recommended that the minimum contract size of derivative contracts traded in the Indian Markets should be pegged not below Rs. 2 Lakhs. Based on this recommendation SEBI has specified that the value of a derivative contract should not be less than Rs. 2 Lakh at the time of introducing the contract in the market. In February 2004, the Exchanges were advised to re-align the contracts sizes of existing derivative contracts to Rs. 2 Lakhs. Subsequently, the Exchanges were authorized to align the contracts sizes as and when required in line with the methodology prescribed by SEBI.",

    "title": "Bonds: Corporate Bonds, Bond Market, Government Bonds, Bond Investments",
    "text": "What is a bond?A bond is a fixed-income security that’s used by governments or companies to raise capital. When you invest in a bond, you essentially lend money to the issuer who in turn pays you back the principal along with the interest amount at a set date.Why invest in bonds?Bonds are a less risky asset than equity which can potentially offer comparable returns over time. Bonds can help you diversify your portfolio and balance out the risk exposure through stocks and other assets.Are bonds safer than stocks?Yes, bonds are generally less risky than stocks because they offer a steady, predictable income at a pre-defined date. However, some bonds have risks.Stocks on the other hand are volatile and the value can fluctuate based on the company’s performance and the market conditions.What are the different types of bonds?There are several types of bonds, each of which have unique characteristics and goals to serve. Here are some of the common ones.These are issued by companies to raise capital and offer returns that are higher than government bonds.Also known as junk bonds, these bonds are issued by companies with lower credit ratings. The interest rates are usually on the higher side to compensate for the lower credit ratings.These are issued by the government and are considered highly safe.Issued by local governments or municipalities to fund public projects, these bonds offer tax-free interest income.These bonds do not pay periodic interests, and are issued at a significant discount to their face value and mature at their full face value. They are more sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to regular bonds.What is a bond yield?Bond yield is the return you as an investor get from a bond, usually shown as a percentage of the bond’s face value. It represents the interest income generated by the bond with respect to its current market price or face value.There are different types of bond yields such as coupon yield, current yield and yield to maturity.How to choose a bond?It starts with determining the investment goal, tenure and risk tolerance, followed by exploring the bond type that suits the goal best. Once you have decided the bond type, assess the credit rating of the bond issuer, evaluate the interest rates, understand the maturity period and payout frequencies. Last but not the least, don’t forget to consider the tax implications.What is a credit rating in a bond and how do they affect prices?A bond credit rating is an assessment of the creditworthiness of a bond which indicates the likelihood of the issuer’s ability to meet its debt obligations. These ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies like CRISIL, CARE and ICRA, and are expressed in a scale of AAA to D, wherein AAA indicates the highest credit quality while D implies default.What happens if interest rates rise?Bond prices are inversely proportional to interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices fall because newer bonds offer higher rates, making older bonds less attractive.What is bond maturity?Bond Maturity is the date when the issuer pays back your principal amount along with any remaining interest payments. Based on their maturity dates, bonds can be classified as the following:Short-term (1-3 years)Medium-term (3-10 years)Long-term (10+ years)Can I lose money in bonds?You can lose money in bonds under the following circumstances:Selling a bond before it matures in a rising rate environmentIssuer defaulting on their paymentsInflation reducing the value of your fixed paymentsCallable bonds being called early before it maturesHow are bonds taxed?The taxation of the bond depends on the type of bond and the income it generates.Interest incomeGovernment bonds - Interest earned on these bonds are fully taxable as per your tax slabCorporate bonds - Interest earned on Corporate bonds are fully taxable as per your tax slabTax-free bonds - Interest earned on these bonds are exempt from taxCapital GainsShort-term Capital Gains - If you sell a bond before three years, any profit is considered a short-term capital gain and is taxed at your regular income tax rate.Long-term Capital Gains - If you sell a bond after holding it for more than three years, the profit is considered a long-term capital gain and is taxed at 20% with indexation benefits.Accretion of DiscountsIf you buy a bond at discount below its face value, the difference can be recognized as income over time or at maturity. This is called accretion.How do I buy bonds?The first step to buying bonds in India is to open a Demat account, where bonds are held electronically. You can open a Demat account through any registered depository participant like a bank or a brokerage firm. You can buy bonds through brokers, banks or online platforms like Jiraaf, Zerodha etc. For new issues, you can participate in the primary market through platforms like the RBI Retail Direct Scheme. While for existing bonds you can buy them from the secondary market through a broker or online trading platform.Once you’ve selected the bonds of your choice, you can place your order through your broker or online platform. The bonds will be credited to your account upon purchase.What is the difference between a debt mutual fund and Bonds?A debt mutual fund pools in money from multiple investors to invest in a portfolio of debt securities including bonds, T bills and other money market instruments. Returns from debt mutual funds can vary based on the performance of the underlying assets. Debt mutual funds are highly liquid and are safer than equity funds.Bonds are debt instruments issued by companies or governments to raise capital. They promise to pay back the principal amount on a specific date and provide interest payments in regular intervals. The returns are predetermined and predictable. Bonds can be traded in the secondary market but they are not as liquid as mutual funds. Bonds are lower risk compared to debt mutual funds, however, they are subject to interest risk and credit risk.How do inflation and bonds relate?Inflation reduces the purchasing power of the fixed interest payments and principal that bonds provide. That apart, RBI often raises interest rates to combat high inflation. When interest rates rise, the prices of existing bonds fall because new bonds are issued with higher yields, making the older bonds less attractive. Sometimes, investors’ expectations of future inflation can also influence bond prices. Expectations of higher inflation will demand higher yields to compensate for the anticipated loss in purchasing power.Inflation-linked bonds are an aberration from the norm. They are designed to protect investors from inflation. The principal value of these bonds increases with inflation, ensuring that the actual value of the investment is maintained.Are bonds a good investment right now?Bonds are a good investment to attain a well-balanced portfolio for all times, as they are stable, predictable and offer inflation-beating returns that are comparable to equities. The allocation may vary (20% to 80%) by investor risk appetite, age of the customer, and investment goals, however, a portfolio without bonds is not ready for capital growth or preservation. The current market volatility is a reminder of how bonds offer a stable investment option and act as a safe haven when equities falter. What makes the Indian bond market even more apt for investment at the moment is the policy reforms in favor of retail investors, inclusion of Indian bonds in foreign indices and steady demand from institutional investors.",

    "title": "PrimaLend Creditors Block Loan Payments to CEO-Controlled Firm",
    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Creditors of bankrupt auto-dealership lender PrimaLend Capital Partners won a temporary halt of monthly loan payments to a firm controlled by the company’s Chief Executive Officer Mark Jensen.Before the payments can resume, US Bankruptcy Judge Mark Mullin said he must decide if the Jensen-affiliated firm actually owns a stake in some PrimaLend loans. The Jensen firm, BVY Partners II, argues that since it paid $34 million for participation rights in the loans, whenever PrimaLend collects loan payments from its borrowers, part of the cash must go to BVY.An official creditor committee in the insolvency case is challenging BVY’s claims. A group of senior noteholders has also questioned at least one BVY deal with PrimaLend, calling it an insider transaction that must be investigated. Those noteholders have told the judge that they had “grave concerns” about PrimaLend’s Chapter 11 filing.The company owes creditors more than $286 million. A representative for BVY did not return a request for comment.PrimaLend’s Bankruptcy Renews Focus on Subprime Consumer StrainMullin scheduled a court hearing for next month to decide whether the payments to BVY are legitimate. In court papers, PrimaLend said it pays out about $350,000 a month to its lender partners. PrimaLend has sided with BVY, claiming that their deal means BVY owns the payments and that PrimaLend is merely collecting money from borrowers as a traditional loan servicer. BVY is an affiliate of PrimaLend that was not placed into bankruptcy. In big, corporate bankruptcy cases, creditors of one unit in a corporate family often challenge any effort to move money away from them to an affiliate.PrimaLend filed bankruptcy in October, blaming its troubles on slowing car sales to customers with poor credit. In July, the company installed an independent manager to oversee an investigation of potential lawsuits that could be filed against insiders for how they ran the company before it filed its insolvency case. That probe is continuing, a company lawyer said during a hearing last month in Forth Worth, Texas. The manager, Matthew Kahn, was given authority to oversee any decisions that might pose a conflict of interest, the company said in a court filing.The case is PrimaLend Capital Partners, LP, 25-90013, US Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas).--With assistance from Eliza Ronalds-Hannon.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

    "title": "Exclusive: Skoda is developing a new, affordable EV tailored for India: Global CEO Klaus Zellmer",
    "text": "Skoda is developing a new, affordable EV tailored for India: CEO Klaus Zellmer By: Prashant Singh | Updated on: 11 Sept 2025, 15:34 pm Skoda Auto’s global CEO, Klaus Zellmer, told HT Auto in an exclusive interaction that the brand is actively developing a new, affordable electric vehicle tailored specifically for the Indian market. ...Read More Skoda Auto’s global CEO, Klaus Zellmer, at the debut of the Vision O concept in Munich, Germany View Personalised Offers on Check Offers Skoda Auto global CEO Klaus Zellmer said the Czech automotive company is actively developing a new, affordable electric vehicle tailored specifically for the Indian market. Skoda Auto, which sells cars such Kylaq, Slavia and Kodiaq, is looking to localise a new electric vehicle platform. The platform, originally developed in China, is being adapted for the Indian market and serve as the foundation for future Skoda and Volkswagen EVs designed specifically for India. \"The big game in terms of battery electric vehicles will start once we have localised our platform called the CMP 21. This platform will then get two hats from Volkswagen and from Skoda,\" Zellmer told HT Auto in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich, Germany. The CMP 21 platform will enable Skoda to develop multiple EVs in India that can effectively compete with rival brands already making steady inroads into the fully electric vehicle segment. “We're also working on potentially bringing over another small battery electric vehicle,\" said Zellmer. The plans assume significance as Skoda prepares for the next chapter of its journey in the Indian market. Skoda India has evolved significantly, especially in the last few years, focusing on localization, quality, and expanding its product line. The brand launched India 2.0 in 2018, investing €1 billion to develop MQB-A0-IN, a localized platform. Key models like the Kushaq and Slavia boosted sales and brand presence. Skoda improved its after-sales service and expanded its dealer network. Despite challenges, including stiff competition and market volatility, it maintained a premium image. By 2025, Skoda plans further EV integration and deeper market penetration. The Next Phase:At IAA Mobility 2025, the company demonstrated its growing expertise in electric mobility with several key unveilings. Among them was the near-production Epiq EV, which is set to define affordable electric mobility for the brand in Europe. Also on display was the striking Skoda Vision O, a brand-new electric wagon concept that reflects the company’s evolving vision—shifting from a traditional, design-enabled approach to one that is driven by technology. Skoda Epiq Not Planned For IndiaWhen asked whether the upcoming Epiq EV would be introduced in the Indian market, Zellmer clarified that Skoda has different plans for India, and the Epiq is not part of the company’s strategy for the region. Skoda views India as an essential “second leg\" to its business, reducing dependence on European markets. This diversification is crucial, given the volatility and geopolitical risks in other regions like China and the US. By investing heavily and committing to localized platforms, Skoda aims to establish a strong foothold in India. \"To depend just on one region is not a good idea. Many other car companies have found that out the hard way with China and the US as we speak. So we want to develop a second pillar or a second leg that we stand on. And the second leg clearly is India,\" said the Skoda Auto CEO. GST 2.0 A Boon For The Indian Car MarketSkoda’s global CEO praised India’s GST reforms, calling it a great initiative. \"This is really a great initiative that will help boost a car industry and car sales that are currently more stagnating than soaring. So I think it's the right decision. It drives consumers towards the lower end of segments,\" he said. Moreover, sharing his thoughts on India pushing E20 fuel, he added that it's a positive approach since it's efficiently cutting down on CO2 emissions. \"You know, generally speaking, I can't talk about the balance between nutrition and biofuels. You know, this is something that needs a deep dive. But generally speaking, the enemy to fight climate change is CO2 and it's not the drivetrain. So anything that cuts back on CO2 emissions, because it's a circular CO2 that is being taken out of the atmosphere when plants grow and then being put back in the atmosphere so it's neutral, is a good move. And that's why I completely appreciate it, as long as it fits in the overall society and its structure,\" added Zellmer.

    "title": "How Taco Bell knows exactly what you want to eat at 2 am",
    "text": "Its market research shows consumers are into the idea, and past inventions, like taco shells made from Doritos chips, were home runs that helped drive sales at the chain of around 7,500 U.S. restaurants. It is on its fourth cheese supplier, and still is trying to figure out how to keep the cheese from disintegrating while the shell waits for fillings like ground beef and yet-more cheese. “It softens up fast,\" Brett Pluskalowski, a Taco Bell product developer, told his boss, Liz Matthews, when she checked in one morning in July. “If you’re talking about it as a crispy cheese taco, you’ve got to deliver crispy cheese.\" Four months on, Taco Bell is still at work. Matthews, who is considered the best in the industry at coming up with new ideas, recently tasted the latest prototype. “Still work to do but I see it happening in the future,\" she says. “I think the team is getting close.\" Matthews wants to test it some more. In the hypercompetitive world of fast food, Matthews is Taco Bell’s chief food innovation officer and the master of a strategy so tricky to pull off that it has snarled up operations at rivals. She churns out, year after year, new items like cheese shells as limited time offers, or LTOs. Chains need LTOs to keep their drive-through menu boards and apps popping with new items to keep customers coming back. The holy grail is a viral sensation online, and millions of dollars in sales. McDonald’s McRib had its first limited run in 1981 and still returns as an LTO. Starbucks turns the Pumpkin Spice Latte into a sign of the season each fall. This year Taco Bell and Matthews are on track to release around two dozen new menu items like a Flamin’ Hot Grilled Cheese Burrito and Cheesy Street Chalupas, double last year’s total. An item that takes years to develop typically stays on the menu for just four to six weeks. LTOs need to be made largely with ingredients and equipment already in the restaurant’s kitchen. Fast-food workers must be able to make them quickly and consistently. Starbucks struggled to quickly serve orders after its drink options grew increasingly complex. At Taco Bell, Matthews needs to maintain profit margins when much of the menu costs less than $5. Taco Bell’s same-store sales have grown annually since 2012, with the exception of a pandemic-driven 1% decrease in 2020—a feat few other restaurant companies can match. The chain is now the fourth largest by U.S. sales, surpassing Burger King and Wendy’s. Earlier this month, Taco Bell reported a 7% increase in same-store sales at a time when many rivals’ sales declined as consumers balk at $15 hamburgers. Matthews understands that her inventions need to be what someone leaving a party on a Saturday night would crave, and she has an instinct for letting her team do radical new things without going too far. Her target customer is someone 18 to 30 years old whom Taco Bell calls a “cultural rebel,\" which it defines as a mindset. Put another way, an internal company executive profile heralded Matthews and other senior women as “the women behind the bro brand.\" In 26 years at Taco Bell, Matthews has helped develop sea-green Baja Blast soda, the Doritos Locos Tacos and the Crunchwrap Supreme, now Taco Bell staples. “The reason she is the GOAT is because she understands the Taco Bell brand better than anyone and she is fearless,\" says Greg Creed, Taco Bell chief executive from 2011 to 2014 who promoted Matthews to chief innovation officer. Taco Bell traces its roots to a menu experiment. In the early 1950s, San Bernardino, Calif., hamburger-stand owner Glen Bell noticed how popular tacos had become at rival restaurants, and started working on a fried, hard-shell version that was assembly line-friendly and easily eaten on the go. He experimented with seasonings, and in 1951 put a 19-cent taco on his menu. There were naysayers, including his wife. “Why take a risk and make a radical change?\" Bell wondered, according to the 1999 book “Taco Titan: The Glen Bell Story.\" They would go on to divorce. Bell’s tacos were a hit, and in 1962 he opened his first Taco Bell in a shopping center south of Los Angeles. The chain grew from there, and by the time Bell sold the company to PepsiCo in 1978 it had around 870 locations. PepsiCo spun off its restaurant chains in 1997, later called Yum Brands. Today Taco Bell’s 8,800 global locations churn out roughly five million tacos daily. Matthews grew up in Los Angeles eating Taco Bell Burrito Supremes, ordered with extra cheese and extra red sauce. (The flour tortilla with beef, refried beans, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, red sauce, sour cream and shredded cheddar remains her go-to order.) The youngest of four children, she was teased by her siblings for remembering family events for what they ate—like the baked salmon at a wedding or mom’s pizza. She waited tables as a teen and went to California State University at Long Beach with a plan to be a psychiatrist. After finding herself thinking more about ways to improve restaurant salads, she switched to food science. View Full Image Liz Matthews, in black apron, and her team try out sauces in the test kitchen. She spent a few years working on pizza at Minnesota-based food company Schwan’s, before making the jump in 1999 to Taco Bell as a junior product developer. Matthews was assigned to work on developing a proprietary soda flavor. Taco Bell had discovered that customers were skipping drinks, and to sell more, it needed a beverage all its own. She headed to PepsiCo’s headquarters in Purchase, N.Y., for research and sampled sugary, caffeinated sodas for six hours straight. “By two o’clock in the afternoon, they put me in a conference room,\" says Matthews of her subsequent caffeine crash. “They’re like, you’re going to need to just take a little nap.\" Her work led to Taco Bell in 2004 introducing Baja Blast, a Mountain Dew variant sold only at Taco Bell. It has gone on to be a top seller. This month, as an LTO in some stores, Taco Bell is selling Baja Blast Pie, a neon green Key lime pie for “a Friendsgiving flex,\" it says. A few years later Matthews tapped Pepsi IP again to develop another cult classic: a taco shell made of Doritos. Her challenge was to retain the chips’ signature color without turning everything around the shell orange. The solution: a paper taco holster (Taco Bell’s word for it) to separate Doritos-infused shells from others. After two years of trial and error, Doritos Locos Tacos debuted in 2012, delivering hundreds of millions in sales in the first year and helping Taco Bell reverse a sales slump. View Full Image (WSJ) A year later, Creed, then-Taco Bell’s CEO, wanted to shake up Taco Bell’s innovation team. He set his sights on Matthews as his new chief innovation officer. She was several ranks below the role, and worried about taking on such a big job with two young children. Creed says he insisted. “I figured at the end of the day, it was going to go really well, or it was going to go epically bad,\" Matthews said. There were flubs, like when Taco Bell added butter to its rice in 2017. “I told Liz, ‘I think we have a problem. My inbox is flooded with complaints,’ \" said Missy Schaaphok, one of Taco Bell’s directors of global food innovation. Vegans were unhappy. Taco Bell nixed the butter. Matthews worked on the 2015 launch of the chain’s Cantina subbrand, which includes around 50 locations featuring late-night hours and booze. Its Las Vegas Strip location features spiked Twisted Freezes, and an in-house wedding chapel. Matthews was key in dreaming up the “Willy Wonka\" touches, said S.G. Ellison, the restaurant’s owner. Matthews oversees a team of about 100 product developers who text each other ideas constantly. They scope out other restaurants and what people are ordering. “It kind of consumes our lives,\" Matthews says. View Full Image Matthews helped dream up fun flourishes at a Taco Bell on the Las Vegas Strip. Each year, Taco Bell tests hundreds of ideas in the Test Kitchen. Promising ones go before what the company calls “sensory panels\" of consumers to taste test. About 40 ideas advance to restaurant testing. Matthews is ultimately the one who decides when to greenlight ideas—or pull the plug. Nearly 20 years after testing various french fries that never took off, Taco Bell started testing them in restaurants again in 2017. Matthews’s team ran through 10 variations before settling on one coated in seasoning and dipped in nacho cheese sauce. For chicken nuggets, tortilla-based masa and jalapeño buttermilk coatings were the key. Taco Bell reintroduced nuggets to menus for a limited time earlier this year: five pieces and a dipping sauce for $3.99. Its limited-offer “nacho fries\" are about $3.80 for a large with sauce. On Matthews’s morning in the lab this summer, developers were picking the right cheese combination for a quesadilla with poblano pepper and steak, which launched this past Thursday as an LTO. Other developers were experimenting with a sauce spray that could spread out flavors more evenly, and a new type of bowl for Taco Bell’s pricier Cantina line, with slow-roasted chicken, corn and a fiery sauce. ​“We call it skunking, right behind the scenes, just really figuring things out,\" said Matthews, as colleagues scrawled ideas for the crispy cheese taco on a white board. She encouraged them to keep going. “This is a fantastic idea,\" she said. Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com",

People refer to stock / index seasonality to identify historical patterns in price fluctuations. This information is then used in taking well informed investment decisions.Seasonality is a tool. It shows historical patterns, not what will happen this year. There are a number of specific seasonal patterns in stocks that people have noticed and tested. These tend to be short-term patterns.Seasonal patterns can be useful, but they can also be traps if we blindly follow them. Seasonality analysis should always be used to control losses, yet that may also mean missing out on some of the trades that could have been profitable.Seasonality analysis is a tendency for a stock / index to perform better during some time periods of the year and worse during others. These time periods can stretch from days to months of the year.Seasonality analysis for a stock / index calculates two numbers: the percentage of time that the month is positive and the average gain/loss for the month.Seasonality tells traders what has happened in the past, which is the historic pattern. There is no mandate that past performance will equal future performance as well. But traders can look for above average tendencies to complement other signals.",

    "text": "THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND WHILE BUYING SILVERSilver rates: On the basis of international market prices, silver rates also change on a regular basis. This is why it is important to keep track of silver prices to buy them at the best rates.Making charges: Just like gold, jewellers may levy making charges on silver jewellery or cutlery. Therefore, it is important to ask directly about the applied making charges to the jewellers.Sellers: People need to research the sellers before purchasing silver to ensure that they buy genuine products with verified purity. This will not only provide them with good quality silver but will also help them to get the best resale value of silver.Certification: While buying silver, it is important to check the certification of the jewellery or the other items.Is investing in silver a bad or good idea?While the cost of silver is far lesser than gold in India, it is still a safe option for investment. Reselling silver jewellery, cutlery, coins, or bars will help get better returns, based on the current market prices.How to Differentiate Between Pure Silver and Sterling Silver?Fine silver is 99.9% pure silver and is soft in comparison to sterling silver. Sterling on the other hand is an alloy that is made mostly of silver and includes a small percentage of copper and zinc to strengthen it. While both of these look almost the same, silver is not very durable due to softness and sterling silver can last a lifetime if properly cared for. On the other hand, sterling silver is more easily tarnished than pure silver, because of the other metals in it.",

    "text": "A US court has issued a default judgement holding Byju Raveendran personally liable for repaying over USD 1 billion, based on a petition filed by BYJU's Alpha and US-based lender GLAS Trust Company LLC, PTI reported.The Delaware Bankruptcy Court found that Raveendran failed to comply with the discovery order and continued to be evasive on several occasions, the report said, citing the judgement issued on November 20.\"The court will enter default judgement against Defendant Raveendran...in the amount of USD 533,000,000, and on Counts II, V and VI in the amount of USD 540,647,109.29,\" the report quoted the judgement.The judgement required Raveendran to deliver a complete and precise account of the Alpha Funds and any related proceeds, such as the Camshaft LP Interest, including all subsequent transfers and resulting proceeds.BYJU's Alpha-GLAS Trust case detailsBYJU's Alpha was established while Raveendran was managing the edtech company Think and Learn Private Limited (TLPL), which functioned under the Byju's brand name.TLPL received a $1 billion Term Loan B from US-based lenders. Subsequently, the lenders alleged that BYJU's Alpha had violated the loan terms, and $533 million of the total debt had been unlawfully transferred out of the US, the report said.The Glas Trust approached the Delaware court and obtained a favourable order to take control of BYJU's Alpha. Meanwhile, both BYJU's Alpha and Glas Trust filed petitions in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court for the discovery of transactions worth $533 million.The November 20 judgement states that Raveendran was aware of the discovery order but simply refused to comply, the report said.The court had also issued a contempt order in the matter, but noted that Raveendran continues to refuse to respond to the discovery requests or pay the sanctions he owes.\"The facts and circumstances of this case indicate that Raveendran's continuing failure to adequately respond to the pending discovery requests is a personal decision by Raveendran, himself,\" the judgement noted.The court rejected Raveendran's argument that the GLAS Trust has access to documents through the books of BYJU'S Alpha on the information they are looking for. It noted that there is nothing in the record to support the assertion GLAS has access to relevant documents.\"The court has also found that Raveendran's behaviour has been a strategic pattern of willful failure to comply with discovery,\" the judgement said.The court has already determined that Raveendran is in contempt of the previous discovery orders and has imposed sanctions of USD 10,000 per day until he purges his contempt.\"The monetary sanctions, however, remain unpaid and have been ineffective. Raveendran lives abroad and apparently has no intention of satisfying his financial penalties or complying with the discovery orders. Accordingly, the monetary sanctions have not provided an effective remedy, making a harsher sanction such as default judgement appropriate in this instance,\" it said.",

    "text": "A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year.Hasina was “found guilty on three counts”, including incitement, order to kill, and inaction to prevent the atrocities, judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder read to the packed court in Dhaka.\"We have decided to inflict her with only one sentence -— that is, sentence of death.\"The ruling comes months before the country's parliamentary elections, expected to take place in early February.Here's what Hasina saidHasina, 78, called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”, Reuters reported.The former PM had defied the court order to return to Bangladesh from India, where she is currently living in exile, to attend her trial about whether she ordered a deadly crackdown against the student-led uprising that ousted her.\"The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,\" Hasina said in a statement issued from hiding in India.\"Not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal where evidence can be weighed, tested fairly,\" she said, adding that she was given no fair chance to defend in court. “We lost control of the situation, but cannot characterise what happened as a premeditated assault on citizens,” the former PM stated.Hasina's Awami League party has been barred from contesting, and it is feared that Monday's verdict could stoke fresh unrest ahead of the vote.The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh's domestic war crimes court located in the capital Dhaka, delivered the guilty verdict amid tight security and in Hasina’s absence after she fled to India in August 2024.Army personnel stand guard in front of the court as the government increases security measures ahead of the verdict on cases against the ousted Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, in Dhaka on 17 November 2025. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir HossainThe verdict can be appealed in the Supreme Court.But Hasina's son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, told Reuters on the eve of the verdict that they would not appeal unless a democratically elected government took office with the Awami League’s participation.What did the judgment say?According to a report by Dhaka Tribune, the judgment concludes that Hasina and the two other accused, former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, had orchestrated and enabled atrocities during the July-August movement.The Awami League leader was tried in absentia. She had fled to New Delhi after the fall of her regime in Dhaka.\"Accused prime minister Sheikh Hasina committed crimes against humanity by her incitement order and also failure to take preventive and punitive measures under charge 1,\" the International Crimes Tribunal said as cited by Al Jazeera.\"Accused Sheikh Hasina committed one count of crimes against humanity by her order to use drones, helicopters and lethal weapons under charge number 2,\" the special tribunal said.What are the charges against Hasina?Sheikh Hasina, who headed the now-banned Awami League party, is facing five serious charges.These include orchestrating mass killings of protesters in Dhaka, the use of helicopters and drones to fire on civilian crowds, the murder of student activist Abu Sayed, the incineration of bodies in Ashulia to destroy evidence and the coordinated killing of demonstrators in Chankharpul.The case against Hasina and her two aides concerns crimes between 15 July and 5 August 2024.The formal charge documents run 8,747 pages, containing references, seized evidence and a detailed list of victims, Dhaka Tribune reported.Live telecast of court proceedingsBangladesh Television broadcast the court proceedings live. Justice Golam Murtaza, who heads the country's International Crimes Tribunal-1, a three-member tribunal overseeing this case, read out the verdict on Monday afternoon.Muhammad Yunus, who heads the interim government in Bangladesh, is likely to hold the next elections in February. Hasina’s party would not get a chance to contest the race.Politically motivated?Hasina had challenged the legitimacy of the Tribunal in an email interview with Reuters last month.“These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” she said. “They have been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. They are presided over by an unelected government which consists of my political opponents.”She also said she was denied adequate notice of the hearings and any meaningful opportunity to mount a defence, adding that she was not personally involved in the use of lethal force or other alleged crimes.Although the Muslim-majority South Asian country of 170 million people has been governed by the interim administration headed by Nobel Peace laureate Yunus since Hasina's departure, political stability has yet to return.In the Reuters interview, Hasina warned of growing anger among supporters of the Awami League and said that millions of party loyalists would boycott the parliamentary elections in February.(With inputs from agencies)",

    "title": "Permabull Tom Lee Sees Bitcoin as High as $200,000 by January’s End",
    "text": "In finance circles, Tom Lee has built a reputation for bullish, audacious and arguably fantastical bets—the S&P 500 index more than doubling by 2030 or Bitcoin reaching $3 million (versus roughly $90,000 today) during that same stretch. But when it comes time for us to make our way from his Midtown Manhattan office to the New York Stock Exchange, on the island’s southernmost tip, Lee is undeniably a realist. At this late-afternoon hour, he knows a brisk 10-block walk to the express train is a much better bet than the hired car his chief marketing officer has suggested we hail. “The train’s always faster,” Lee says.It’s a chilly November day, and Lee—sporting his trademark dark suit, black-rimmed glasses and famously voluminous hair—has just wrapped up a jam-packed day of meetings at his research firm, Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, including a tight 50 minutes with me. His office is flanked by a quartet of 6-foot camera lights for his frequent appearances as a contributor on CNBC, but I’m more surprised by a different furnishing: Tucked into a corner is a small bed, added four years ago as a refuge after long-haul flights.",
