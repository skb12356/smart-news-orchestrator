This suggests that the stock could list around Rs 135–136, reflecting upbeat market sentiment ahead of its official debut.Excelsoft Technologies IPO detailsExcelsoft Technologies has launched a Rs 500 crore IPO, comprising a fresh issue of 1.50 crore shares worth Rs 180 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 2.67 crore shares totaling Rs 320 crore.The price band is set at Rs 114–120 per share, and the lot size is 125 shares. At the upper end of the band, the IPO implies a market capitalisation of around Rs 1,381 crore. The shares have a face value of Rs 10 each and are proposed to list on both the BSE and NSE. The allocation split is 50% for QIBs, 35% for retail investors, and 15% for non-institutional investors.About the companyExcelsoft Technologies is a vertical SaaS company operating in the global learning and assessment ecosystem. Its offerings include AI-driven learning tools, assessment and testing platforms, online proctoring solutions, learning experience platforms, student success tools, and digital eBook products.Key products include SARAS e-Assessments, EasyProctor, SARAS Learning Solutions, OpenPage, EnablED, CollegeSparc, and LearnActiv. The company caters to around 76 clients worldwide, including major players like the Pearson Group, and derives a large portion of its revenue from long-term, recurring contracts.The funds from the fresh issue will be directed towards expansion initiatives. This includes capex for a new property in Mysore—covering land acquisition and construction—along with upgrades to electrical systems, investments in software, hardware, and network infrastructure, and general corporate purposes.Financial performanceExcelsoft has demonstrated strong financial momentum. Its restated consolidated total income increased to Rs 233.29 crore in FY25, up from Rs 198.30 crore in FY24 and Rs 195.10 crore in FY23. Net profit rose sharply to Rs 34.69 crore in FY25, compared with Rs 12.75 crore in FY24 and Rs 22.41 crore in FY23, signaling a significant recovery in profitability.The company reported an EBITDA margin of 31.40% in FY25, versus 27.72% in FY24 and 34.94% in FY23. Its net worth stood at Rs 371.29 crore in FY25, and return on capital employed (RoCE) was 16.11%.Risk factorsExcelsoft is heavily dependent on the Pearson Education Group, which contributes about 59% of its revenue, creating a meaningful client concentration risk.Global operations expose it to multiple regulatory and compliance regimes, while the SaaS business model can delay revenue recognition and affect short-term cash flows. The company also operates in a space where cybersecurity and data protection are critical, given the sensitive nature of education and assessment data.Should you subscribe?From a valuation perspective, the IPO appears expensive. Based on the FY25 earnings per share of ₹3.47, the issue is priced at approximately 34.62 times its pre-IPO earnings—a level that sits on the higher side compared with the valuation multiples of listed technology and IT services peers mentioned in the note.Although the company operates in a specialised and fast-growing vertical SaaS segment and maintains strong, long-term global client relationships, a P/E ratio close to 35 offers limited comfort for investors who prioritize a substantial margin of safety at the time of listing.As Swastika Investmart noted, “The issue seems aggressively priced (P/E of 35), prompting a neutral outlook with expectations of only modest listing",

    "content_text": "IRS Stimulus Check November 2025: IRS has issued no update about any new stimulus check for November, yet rumors have continued to spread across social media as comments from President Donald Trump and various state rebate programs create confusion among Americans. There are no federal relief payments scheduled for the rest of 2025. The speculation intensified after Trump again mentioned tariff-funded rebate checks. He previously suggested payments of $1,000 to $2,000 and even floated figures up to $5,000 earlier in July alongside former DOGE chief Elon Musk, according to Axios. None of these ideas became formal legislation. Congress has not introduced or approved any stimulus bill. The IRS has also not prepared any new rollout. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he has not discussed stimulus checks with the president and noted that the administration’s tax agenda—such as no tax on tips, overtime, or Social Security—may offer relief instead. The last real stimulus-related payment available to Americans was the $1,400 Recovery Rebate Credit tied to the 2021 pandemic package. The final deadline to claim it was April 15, 2025. No new program has been announced since. The IRS warns that stimulus misinformation has triggered a new wave of scams. Fraudsters misuse the term “stimulus check” and attempt to steal banking information, Social Security numbers, and refunds. The IRS never sends messages through social media. It never texts taxpayers without consent. It never calls to demand payments, threaten arrest, or promise fast refunds. The agency stresses that any real stimulus would require Congressional approval, a signed law, and an official IRS announcement. None of these steps have occurred. As of mid-November 2025, there are no IRS payments, no pending stimulus bills, and no federal rebate checks coming this year. The circulating November stimulus rumors remain false.No IRS Stimulus Check Is Scheduled for November 2025Searches for “IRS stimulus check November 2025” have exploded. Viral posts claim new payments worth $1,390, $1,702, or $2,000 are arriving through direct deposit.But the IRS has not announced any new stimulus or federal relief payments for 2025 or 2026.The IRS newsroom for November lists only routine tax updates. Its Economic Impact Payment page is now marked historical, confirming that all COVID-era stimulus checks ended with the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit.Major U.S. outlets are consistent on this point. Reports note that no federal stimulus checks are approved for the rest of 2025, and no IRS program is running any national direct deposit relief payments.Any post promising a surprise “IRS stimulus arriving this week” has no official basis.Why $1,390, $1,702 and $2,000 Went Viral OnlineThe dollar amounts circulating on TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook come from a mix of real programs and false claims.The $1,702 number usually traces back to Alaska’s 2024–2025 Permanent Fund Dividend, which is only for Alaska residents. It is not a national IRS payment.The $1,390 figure appears in widely reported scam posts. Consumer alerts in multiple states have flagged fake messages using this amount to lure people into sharing personal details.The $2,000 figure comes from a political proposal, not a live federal program. None of these amounts represent an active IRS direct deposit stimulus check in November 2025.If a message links to a sign-up page or asks for bank login details, it is not legitimate.Trump’s $2,000 Tariff Dividend: A Real Proposal, Not an IRS Payment YetPresident Donald Trump has promoted a $2,000 “tariff dividend” plan. He claims revenue from global tariffs could be paid out to millions of Americans.The White House says Trump is committed to exploring this design. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has floated income limits similar to past stimulus.But the plan is not law. Congress must approve funding and authorize the IRS to distribute payments.Budget analysts say current tariff revenue is far too small to cover broad $2,000 payments.A Supreme Court review of the tariffs adds even more uncertainty.For now, the tariff dividend remains a proposal, not a real IRS stimulus check.DOGE Checks and the DOGE Dividend Are Policy Ideas, Not Active PaymentsPosts about “DOGE checks” or a “DOGE dividend” continue to spread online. These refer to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and a proposal that some savings could be paid to taxpayers.The concept has generated attention, especially after high-profile endorsements.However, DOGE has not launched any payment system. Independent reviews show that documented savings fall far short of what would be required for nationwide payouts.No DOGE payments are scheduled for November 2025, and no IRS infrastructure exists for such checks.How to Avoid 2025 IRS Stimulus ScamsScams are rising as fake posts imitate IRS branding. The IRS warns that it never initiates stimulus or refund contact through text, email, or social media.Fraud attempts often use urg",

    "content_text": "Shares of Jaiprakash Power Ventures (JP Power) surged 11.75% to Rs 22.63 on Thursday, extending the previous day’s sharp 15% rise as investor sentiment improved following a major breakthrough in the Jaypee Group’s insolvency proceedings. In the last two trading sessions, JP Power shares have rallied nearly 30%.The rally comes after the Gautam Adani-led Adani Group secured approval from the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to acquire Jaiprakash Associates Ltd., the debt-ridden infrastructure and industrial conglomerate undergoing insolvency resolution.According to a regulatory filing made on Wednesday, Adani Enterprises confirmed that the creditors voted in favour of its resolution plan. The company stated it received a Letter of Intent (LoI) from the Resolution Professional on November 19, 2025.The deal is worth nearly $1.5 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing people in the know. ET could not independently verify this amount. ReadThe implementation of the resolution plan may be undertaken by Adani Enterprises, entities within its promoter group, other Adani Group companies, or through a special purpose vehicle, depending on the final structure approved under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.Jaiprakash Associates, the flagship of the Jaypee Group, operates across multiple sectors, including engineering and construction, cement, power, real estate, fertilisers, and hospitality. The acquisition marks another significant expansion move by the Adani Group and is expected to reshape the landscape for several of these sectors.Market participants are viewing the development as a potential breakthrough for both the Jaypee Group’s ongoing insolvency process and for JP Power’s near-term outlook, fueling continued investor enthusiasm in the stock.On the technical front, the Daily RSI (14) for Jaiprakash Power Ventures stands at 74.9, which places it in the overbought zone, as readings above 70 typically indicate heightened buying pressure. This suggests the stock may be due for a near-term pullback or consolidation.Also read: Groww shares fall 18% in 2 days. What’s triggering the fall in Billionbrains?Additionally, the stock is currently trading above all eight of its key Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), reflecting strong upward momentum. This alignment of moving averages is generally viewed as a bullish technical signal, reinforcing the stock’s prevailing positive trend.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

This suggests that the IPO is fairly priced. The company’s strong market leadership in clean air and advanced automotive components, combined with rising demand for SUVs and premium vehicles, a strategically diversified product portfolio, long-standing OEM partnerships, and access to global R&D, positions Tenneco well to tap into both domestic growth and export opportunities. Given these strengths, we recommend a ‘Subscribe for Long Term Only’ rating for the issue.",

    "content_text": "Billionbrains (Groww) stock has been on a roller-coaster since listing, rising sharply in the first few sessions and then hitting a lower circuit. Much of this movement is driven by a combination of strong post-listing demand, extremely low free float and rich valuations that make the stock more sensitive to any change in sentiment. Together, these factors have created a setup where even small orders can significantly impact the price.Strong post listing demandThe first trigger came from heavy buying after listing. Investors chased the stock as soon as it debuted, leading to a steep rise in the first few sessions. Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities said the early up move reflected strong demand and a rush of traders trying to enter the counter.He added that investors were also giving Groww a high multiple because of its market share and strong user growth. \"So the rally is a mix of short-term technical factors and long-term business expectations,\" he said.Also Read: Inside the short-selling trap of Groww's near multibagger surge: What happened and what it means for investors?Extreme low free floatThe second factor is Groww's extremely low free float. Only around 7% of the company’s shares are currently available for trading, while almost 93% remain locked in with IPO investors. With so few shares actually circulating in the market, demand easily overwhelms supply.In such stocks, even small buying orders can push the price sharply higher because there simply aren’t enough sellers. This also creates the conditions for shorts to get squeezed, which happened with Groww in earlier sessions.Traders who sold shares without owning them were unable to buy them back when the stock began rising, which forced them to cover at higher prices and added to the volatility.Valuation storyThe third factor is the valuation story. Groww's market cap has crossed Rs 1.15 lakh crore at one point, far above the implied valuation of about Rs 61,000 crore at IPO pricing. Some analysts believe this stretch in valuation is adding to selling pressure currently.Vipul Bhowar of Waterfield Advisors said the company is receiving \"tech-style valuations\" because of its rapid user growth, but he warned that the broking business is cyclical and sensitive to market activity.When markets slow, broking revenues can fall just as fast. He also pointed out that the industry is highly competitive and tightly regulated, making very high multiples hard to justify for long periods.Also read: Worried about an AI stock bubble? That might be good news for Nifty bullsPut together, these three elements -- strong initial demand, very low free float and premium valuations -- have turned Groww into one of the most volatile newly listed stocks. As long as the float remains tight and investor appetite remains high, price swings may continue. The stock is currently trading in a zone where fundamentals, sentiment and technical factors are all pulling at the same time, making the ride bumpy for traders and investors alike.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "content_text": "Cloudflare outage on November 18, 2025, caused major disruptions across the internet. Millions of users could not access services like X, ChatGPT, Spotify, Uber, and even popular gaming platforms. The problem began early Tuesday morning, around 6:20 a.m. ET, after the company detected a sudden surge in unusual traffic. This triggered internal system errors, affecting a massive chunk of global web traffic.By the peak, outage-monitoring sites recorded nearly 5,000 user reports. The number dropped to around 600 by 8 a.m. ET as some services started to recover. A fix was deployed around 9:42 a.m. ET, gradually restoring stability. Cloudflare confirmed that no customer data was compromised, and there is no evidence of a cyberattack.Shares of Cloudflare fell roughly 3% in morning trading following the outage. Investors reacted to concerns about operational reliability. Cloudflare handles over 20% of all web traffic globally, making any downtime highly visible and impactful. Outages like this highlight the risks of centralized web infrastructure and how dependent businesses and users are on a few major providers.The incident caused widespread inconvenience. Users reported login failures, errors, and slow access across multiple services. Streaming platforms, social media apps, transit services, and gaming networks all faced temporary interruptions. The outage showed how even a short disruption in infrastructure can ripple through industries, affecting millions of people within minutes.Cloudflare acted quickly to stabilize its systems. Services began returning to normal by mid-morning, though some users experienced lingering errors. Transparency will be key in regaining client and investor trust. Clear communication about the root cause, remediation steps, and improved fail-safe mechanisms can help restore confidence.The Cloudflare outage comes shortly after other major internet infrastructure disruptions. Past events at Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure have shown that reliability and trust are essential in the web infrastructure industry. Each outage reinforces the need for robust monitoring, redundancy, and contingency planning.For investors, short-term caution is expected until confidence returns. Medium-term impacts could include slower growth, increased client scrutiny, or margin pressure from investments in resilience. For users, the event is a stark reminder that the internet’s smooth functioning depends on a few critical providers.Why did Cloudflare’s outage affect so many services?Cloudflare plays a key role in global internet traffic, handling more than 20% of all websites. Its network connects countless apps and services, from social media to streaming platforms and gaming. When a major disruption occurs, the effects are felt far and wide.The scale of the outage shows how centralized web infrastructure can amplify problems. A single point of failure in such systems can impact multiple services at once. Many organizations rely heavily on Cloudflare for performance, security, and uptime. As a result, even a short disruption can trigger widespread user frustration and operational slowdowns.For businesses, these interruptions can have financial and reputational consequences. Users may abandon apps or platforms during downtime, and companies may incur costs to resolve issues or compensate affected customers.Investors also pay close attention. Stock prices can react quickly to operational problems in critical infrastructure companies, reflecting concerns about reliability, customer trust, and potential revenue impacts.How did the stock market react to the Cloudflare outage?Cloudflare’s shares fell by around 3% in morning trading on the day of the outage. The drop highlights investor sensitivity to operational reliability in internet infrastructure companies.Market watchers note that outages in major infrastructure providers can trigger broader concern. Investors worry about customer churn, contractual penalties, and potential costs for improving systems to prevent future failures. In sectors like cybersecurity and content delivery, trust and uptime are critical. Even a temporary disruption can weigh heavily on sentiment.Analysts suggest that confidence may remain cautious until Cloudflare provides a clear explanation of the root cause and reassurances about improved safeguards. For companies relying on Cloudflare, the event may prompt them to explore backup solutions, multiple vendors, or revised contracts to reduce dependency risks.What caused the Cloudflare outage and how was it fixed?Cloudflare reported that the outage was triggered by a sudden surge in traffic, which caused internal errors and system degradation. This “internal service disruption” affected several services simultaneously, including AI platforms, social networks, and gaming systems.The company acted quickly to stabilize its network. A fix was deployed around 9:42 a.m. ET, after which most services gradually returned to normal. By late",

    "content_text": "Budget 2025 Highlights: In a big boost to the Indian middle class, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday announced that there will be no income tax payable for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh, and Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers (including standard deduction) in the new tax regime.Here's a look at new tax slabs;Income up to Rs 4 lakh (per annum) ----- Nil Between Rs 4 and 8 lakh ---------------- 5 per cent (tax) Between Rs 8 and 12 lakh --------------- 10 per cent Between Rs 12 and 16 lakh -------------- 15 per centBetween Rs16 and 20 lakh --------------- 20 per cent Between Rs 20 and 24 lakh -------------- 25 per cent Above Rs 24 lakh ------------------------- 30 per centNil tax slab will apply for annual income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers with standard deduction of Rs 75,000) under new tax regime.Here's a summary of all the major Budget announcements;Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has put the middle class squarely at the centre of her Budget by announcing nil income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income. Her previous budgets were marked by huge amounts of money marked for capital expenditure aimed at building infrastructure such as railways and highways. In this budget, Sitharaman has decided to raise capital expenditure at a lower rate. The capital expenditure for 2025-26 will be 11.2 lakh crore, marginally higher from Rs 11.1 lakh crore in the previous budget when she had raised it by 11%, slowing down the breathtaking speed in previous years. Known for her prudent budgeting, she has stayed the course on fiscal deficit by announcing it to be 4.4% for next financial year when it was expected to be below 4.5%. Sitharaman has also not taken her attention off the Viksit Bharat roadmap as she has detailed plans to rejuvenate several critical sectors such as agriculture and small industry, calling them engines of development. She has also laid emphasis on human capacity enhancement and skilling as well as outlining a reformist agenda for several sectors. These steps aim at powering economic growth in the long run. Sitharaman's Budget is high on hope when consumer demand is low, inflation has hit the common people, and GDP growth has slumped while concerns over job creation persist.This Budget comes as GDP growth is projected to fall to a four-year low of 6.4% in FY24, near its decadal average. The Economic Survey forecasts 6.3-6.8% growth in FY26, well below the pace required to achieve Viksit Bharat by 2047. It stresses the need for land and labour reforms to drive growth.With India's world-leading growth showing signs of moderation, the push for an 8% annual growth rate remains crucial. The projected growth for FY25-26 compares to an estimated 6.4% in FY24 and 8.2% in FY23-24.Budget 2025 Live streaming: When and where to watch Nirmala Sitharaman’s speech;Budget Speech Timing: Scheduled for 11 a.m. on February 1 in the Lok Sabha.Live Broadcast: Available on Sansad TV, DD News, and Sansad TV’s YouTube channel.Online Updates: Follow all Budget 2025 updates on economictimes.comKey numbers to watch out for in the Union Budget for 2025-26:Fiscal DeficitCapital ExpenditureDebt RoadmapBorrowingTax RevenueGSTNominal GDPDividendDisinvestment & Asset MonetisationBudget FAQsWhat is the Union Budget?The Union Budget is the annual financial statement of the government.

    "content_text": "The Nifty is the flagship benchmark of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), which is a well-diversified index, comprising top 50 companies in terms of free-float market capitalisation that are traded on the bourse.Officially called the Nifty 50, the index is computed using the free float market capitalisation method, which is essentially the count of shares in active circulation in the market at any given point of time.The Nifty, just like BSE benchmark Sensex, is today used for benchmarking portfolios and returns of mutual fund schemes and launching index funds.The Nifty index was launched on April 22, 1996, with a base value of 1,000 counted from November 3, 1995. Live Nifty quotes are available on nseIndia.com, ETMarkets.com and numerous other web platforms and TV channels at any point of time.The Nifty 50 is owned and managed by NSE Indices Limited (formerly known as India Index Services & Products Limited-IISL), a specialized company focused on an index as a core product.The review of Nifty 50 is undertaken semi-annually based on data for six months ending January and July. The replacement of stocks in Nifty 50 (if any) is implemented from the last trading day of March and September. In case of any replacement in the index, a four weeks' prior notice is given to the market participants.Additional index reconstitution may be undertaken in case any of the index constituent undergoes merger, demerger, delisting, specific cases of capital restructuring etc., in case any of the index constituent is moved to BZ series, if trading permission of any of the index constituent is withdrawn from F&O segment, if a security is suspended for trading from Capital Market for any reason and in case of any adverse regulatory findings or orders issued against any of the index constituent that necessitates removal of such stock from the index.In case of a capital restructuring or voluntary delisting, equity shareholders' approval is considered as a trigger to initiate the replacement of such stock from the index through additional index reconstitution. For all other cases, replacements will be initiated based on notifications issued by the Exchange. Further, additional index reconstitution may be undertaken to screen for continued eligibility of an index constituent that may have undergone corporate action involving demerger in accordance with the guidelines prescribed under a separate section 'Corporate actions involving demerger/ spin-off' of this document.There are defined eligibility criteria for selection of Nifty constituent stocks. The liquidity of a stock is measured by the market impact cost, which is essentially the cost involved in transacting a stock. For a stock to qualify for inclusion in the Nifty50, it must have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less for six months and for 90 per cent of observation cases. The constituents should have derivative contracts available on NSE.Disclaimer: This report is authored by an external party.

With no formal education, she began planting and nurturing the trees, treating them as her children to cope with the void of being childless. Thimmakka received 12 major awards for her work, including the Padma Shri in 2019, the Nadoja Award from Hampi University in 2010, the National Citizen Award in 1995 and the Indira Priyadarshini Vrikshamitra Award in 1997.Tributes from Karnataka CM and Environment ministerKarnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah posted his on X, saying he was “deeply saddened” by the news. He said Timmakka, who planted thousands of trees and nurtured them like her own children, had dedicated most of her life to environmental conservation. He added that her love for nature had made her “immortal” and that the region had become poorer with her demise. “My salutations to the departed great soul. I pray that the departed soul attains eternal peace. My condolences to their family,” he said.Karnataka environment minister Eshwar Khandre visited Apollo Hospital in Jayanagar to pay his respects. He said the Padma Shri awardee, who nurtured trees like her own children, was a “living embodiment of love for the environment.” He added that her selfless service, simplicity and affection would remain an “eternal inspiration.”(With inputs from PTI)",

    "content_text": "On November 18, 2025, AYANEO hosted a new product showcase, presenting the AYANEO Pocket VERT for the first time. Designed for vertical retro handheld enthusiasts, this top-tier device was revealed live by AYANEO CEO Arthur, highlighting its exceptional design, exquisite craftsmanship, and powerful performance. Whether you are a fan of retro handhelds or a modern gamer seeking high performance, the Pocket VERT offers an experience that ignites passion and exceeds expectations. AYANEO’s mission: delivering the purest handheld gaming experience for true gamers As a pioneer in the handheld gaming industry, AYANEO has always upheld the philosophy of “Real Gamers, Know Gamers,” continuously exploring how to deliver the purest handheld gaming experiences. From Windows to Android handhelds, from horizontal to vertical designs, every innovation stems from deep understanding of player needs and long-term commitment. AYANEO & KONKR: a dual-brand strategy In July 2025, AYANEO officially launched its new sub-brand, KONKR. While AYANEO focuses on high-end premium products, KONKR emphasizes high performance and value. Under this dual-brand strategy, AYANEO’s ecosystem has become richer, offering players more personalized choices. The Pocket VERT represents AYANEO’s latest premium vertical handheld offering. Continuous evolution in Android handhelds: from Pocket S to Pocket DMG AYANEO has consistently surprised players in the Android handheld market. The Pocket S, the first high-end Android handheld from AYANEO, set the industry benchmark with its craftsmanship and flagship-level performance. Subsequent models, including the Pocket S2, expanded the ecosystem further. In the vertical handheld segment, the Pocket DMG brought the nostalgic charm of classic devices to modern handhelds, catering to retro enthusiasts. Pursuit of excellence: achieving Pocket S-level quality in a vertical format For years, gamers have hoped for a vertical handheld that matches the high-end feel and comprehensive experience of the Pocket S series. Tackling the challenge of transforming this experience into a vertical form, AYANEO has reimagined what a premium vertical Android handheld can be. The Pocket VERT answers this ambition, delivering an even more refined and ultimate vertical experience. AYANEO Pocket VERT: the ultimate dream device for vertical retro handheld enthusiasts The debut of Pocket VERT marks a new height in vertical handheld aesthetics and experience. It is more than a gaming device—it is a collectible masterpiece that embodies retro nostalgia, design aesthetics, and artistic dedication. Exquisite aesthetics: an art-level handheld in minimalist form Continuing AYANEO’s minimalist design language, the Pocket VERT uses pure lines, balanced proportions, and precise structures to create a unified and sophisticated visual order. Every detail is crafted to artistic standards, making the device feel like a playable sculpture. Compact and refined, it measures 86.4mm × 143mm × 20.5mm, ,and combines premium feel with extreme portability. Craftsmanship breakthrough: a never-before-seen combination of techniques The Pocket VERT employs full-body CNC precision carving instead of traditional stamping. Multiple passes ensure every surface, chamfer, and cutout achieves perfect consistency. As the first handheld brand to introduce a unified glass panel, AYANEO has further advanced this technique in the Pocket VERT. The front glass panel seamlessly connects with the body, creating smooth, natural transitions. The result is a clean, transparent visual, precise touch response, and a strong sense of unity and futuristic design. The ultimate screen for retro enthusiasts The screen is always the centerpiece of any handheld experience. Pocket VERT features a 3.5\" LTPS high-resolution display—long a dream for retro gamers—offering 1600×1440 resolution, 615 PPI, 10× GB point-to-point pixel accuracy, and 450 nits full-screen brightness. From retro classics to modern mobile games, it delivers crystal-clear visuals, arguably the sharpest display on any Android handheld. Artistic expression in color aesthetics As a trendsetter in handheld color design, AYANEO offers a new artistic palette for the Pocket VERT。 Midnight Black – deep and steady, reflecting the golden era of classic handhelds Moon White – pure and elegant, soft and refined like moonlight Lava Red – vibrant and intense, full of craftsmanship and artistic passion Seamless, umarked button design Building on the acclaimed umarked button design of the Pocket S, the Pocket VERT pushes aesthetics further with a full umarked button layout. Every button blends seamlessly with the overall design, achieving a perfect union of minimalist beauty and practical functionality. Crystal-textured buttons: elegant, durable, and precise Crafted from transparent crystal-like material, the buttons catch and refract light, creating a unique handheld light-and-shadow aesthetic.
