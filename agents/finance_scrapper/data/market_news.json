    "content_text": "What are Derivatives? The term \"Derivative\" indicates that it has no independent value, i.e. its value is entirely \"derived\" from the value of the underlying asset. The underlying asset can be Securities, Commodities, Bullion, Currency, Livestock or anything else. In other words, Derivative means a forward, future, option or any other hybrid contract of pre determined fixed duration, linked for the purpose of contract fulfillment to the value of a specified real or financial asset or to an index of securities. With Securities Laws (Second Amendment) Act,1999, Derivatives has been included in the definition of Securities. The term Derivative has been defined in Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, as:- �a security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan, whether secured or unsecured, risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security; �a contract which derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, of underlying securities. What is a Futures Contract? Futures Contract means a legally binding agreement to buy or sell the underlying security on a future date. Future contracts are the organized/standardized contracts in terms of quantity, quality (in case of commodities), delivery time and place for settlement on any date in future. The contract expires on a pre-specified date which is called the expiry date of the contract. On expiry, futures can be settled by delivery of the underlying asset or cash. Cash settlement enables the settlement of obligations arising out of the future/option contract in cash. What is an Option Contract? Option Contract is a type of Derivatives Contract which gives the buyer/holder of the contract the right (but not the obligation) to buy/sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price within or at end of a specified period. The buyer/holder of the option purchases the right from the seller/writer for a consideration which is called the premium. The seller/writer of an option is obligated to settle the option as per the terms of the contract when the buyer/holder exercises his right. The underlying asset could include securities, an index of prices of securities etc. Under Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act,1956 options on securities has been defined as \"option in securities\" means a contract for the purchase or sale of a right to buy or sell, or a right to buy and sell, securities in future, and includes a teji, a mandi, a teji mandi, a galli, a put, a call or a put and call in securities. An Option to buy is called Call option and option to sell is called Put option. Further, if an option that is exercisable on or before the expiry date is called American option and one that is exercisable only on expiry date, is called European option. The price at which the option is to be exercised is called Strike price or Exercise price. Therefore, in the case of American options the buyer has the right to exercise the option at anytime on or before the expiry date. This request for exercise is submitted to the Exchange, which randomly assigns the exercise request to the sellers of the options, who are obligated to settle the terms of the contract within a specified time frame. As in the case of futures contracts, option contracts can be also be settled by delivery of the underlying asset or cash. However, unlike futures cash settlement in option contract entails paying/receiving the difference between the strike price/exercise price and the price of the underlying asset either at the time of expiry of the contract or at the time of exercise / assignment of the option contract. What are Index Futures and Index Option Contracts? Futures contract based on an index i.e. the underlying asset is the index, are known as Index Futures Contracts. For example, futures contract on NIFTY Index and BSE-30 Index. These contracts derive their value from the value of the underlying index. Similarly, the options contracts, which are based on some index, are known as Index options contract. However, unlike Index Futures, the buyer of Index Option Contracts has only the right but not the obligation to buy / sell the underlying index on expiry. Index Option Contracts are generally European Style options i.e. they can be exercised / assigned only on the expiry date. An index, in turn derives its value from the prices of securities that constitute the index and is created to represent the sentiments of the market as a whole or of a particular sector of the economy. Indices that represent the whole market are broad based indices and those that represent a particular sector are sectoral indices. In the beginning futures and options were permitted only on S&P Nifty and BSE Sensex. Subsequently, sectoral indices were also permitted for derivatives trading subject to fulfilling the eligibility criteria. Derivative contracts may be permitted on an index if 80% of the index constituents are individually eligible for derivatives trading. However, no single ineligible stock in ",

People refer to stock / index seasonality to identify historical patterns in price fluctuations. This information is then used in taking well informed investment decisions.Seasonality is a tool. It shows historical patterns, not what will happen this year. There are a number of specific seasonal patterns in stocks that people have noticed and tested. These tend to be short-term patterns.Seasonal patterns can be useful, but they can also be traps if we blindly follow them. Seasonality analysis should always be used to control losses, yet that may also mean missing out on some of the trades that could have been profitable.Seasonality analysis is a tendency for a stock / index to perform better during some time periods of the year and worse during others. These time periods can stretch from days to months of the year.Seasonality analysis for a stock / index calculates two numbers: the percentage of time that the month is positive and the average gain/loss for the month.Seasonality tells traders what has happened in the past, which is the historic pattern. There is no mandate that past performance will equal future performance as well. But traders can look for above average tendencies to complement other signals.",

The main barrier against the functioning of a common political party is the region’s diversity. The region has many ethnic tribes, having their own identity issues Nitish Kumar: A resilient politician who keeps rising like a PhoenixKumar is among the 10 longest-serving CMs in the country. He has been in power for 19 years. His frequent switching sides in his political career earned him the nickname 'Paltu Ram', whereas he is also called 'sushashan babu' for good governance. OPINION | Bangladesh heads for strife as Jamaat and Awami League face offSheikh Hasina’s death sentence was foreseen.

It leaves Awami League as the only meaningful opposition, which may even nudge its traditional political rivals to quietly back it OPINION | New Bihar government must prioritise NITI Aayog’s service sector job planNITI Aayog’s recommendations mirror the economic realities of the state and what is easily doable.
